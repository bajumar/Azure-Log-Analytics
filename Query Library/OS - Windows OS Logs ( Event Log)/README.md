These queries are based on the data collected from Windows Event Log.

## Prerequisites

Enable Windows Event Log Collection: <https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/data-sources-windows-events>

### Identifying the Required Logs for Queries

The first "where" filter in each query identifies the required Event Log, Event Source, and Event Level.

## Snippet Documents

Documents prefixed with *"Snippet"* contain useful re-usable code samples that you can use in your own queries to simplify query creation.

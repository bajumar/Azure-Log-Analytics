# Welcome to My Query Library!

The library is orgainized by folder, where the folder name indicates the service or solution that the contained queries target.

The README document in each folder will identify the prerequisites and may contain additional commentary that is relevant to the successful implemtation of the query examples. In each folder you will also find an *"ALL... ...QUERIES"* code file, which is a compilation of all the queries in a single file should you wish to copy them all at once.

The folders prefixed with *"Use-Cases:"* contain queries which may leverage data from multiple services or solutions, to address a specific scenario.

# Welcome to My Query Library!

The library is organized by folder, where the folder name indicates the service or solution which the contained queries target.

## Query Documents

In each folder you will also find an *"ALL... ...QUERIES"* code file, which is a compilation of all the queries in a single file should you wish to copy them all at once.

Individual query documents have names starting with the type of visualization that is produced followed by a description of the information that is displayed. For example, running the query contained in...

+ "Table - Computer Geo-Locations" produces a table which lists each Computer name along with the geographic co-ordinates (latitude and longitude) of its location.

+ "LineChart - Trend of Total Storage Consumption" produces a line chart showing the amount of storage consumed over time, where time progression is on the x-axis and the consumption value is on the y-axis.

## Snippet Documents

Documents prefixed with *"Snippet"* contain useful re-usable code samples that you can use in your own queries to simplify query creation.

## Scenarios

The folders prefixed with *"Scenarios"* contain queries which may leverage data from multiple services or solutions, to address specific reporting requirements.

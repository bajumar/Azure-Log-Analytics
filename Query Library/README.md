# Welcome to My Query Library!

The library is organized by folder, where the folder name indicates the service or solution that the contained queries target.

The README document in each folder will identify the prerequisites and may contain additional commentary that is relevant to the successful implementation of the query examples. In each folder you will also find an *"ALL... ...QUERIES"* code file, which is a compilation of all the queries in a single file should you wish to copy them all at once. In some folders you may see an *"ALL... ...SNIPPETS"* code file, which contains useful re-usable snippets of code to simplify query development.

The folders prefixed with *"Scenarios"* contain queries which may leverage data from multiple services or solutions, to address specific reporting requirements.
